    <td>
    </td>
    <td  class="right">
        Well, when we provision servers, we use templates, of course, so they are born identical.  But since that moment, every configuration and deployment is handcrafted. Ops can login into servers and change their configuration, maybe perform tests with developers and rollback settings, perform some fine tuning and so on…. So, those two identical servers tend to diverge more and more over time. That’s what we call “Configuration shift”. We started with identical servers, but we end up with unique servers. So unique they are like snowflakes. hat’s why we really need Anna to be onboard. She’s the only one you can rely on to configure SNTP101 during deployments, because she knows such server better than her dog.

Later in the morning and in the afternoon we have hordes of customers and we cannot have downtimes.
