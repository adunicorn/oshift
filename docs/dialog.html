        Think of farmers. They easily have thousand of sheep. They don’t give them names. They manage them all together, as a cattle. They say "Let's buy 20% more sheep", or "move half the sheep from here to there". If 3 sheep dies, they replace them, it’s a number. They are all identical.

        Yes, and a lot of much smaller companies too. It's not about the amount of servers: it's about where you want to put your focus. Business capabilities vs the single servers. We could do the same. We could use special software for orchestrating our cattle of servers.

        You know, Brent, a lot of huge companies have been investing on this field, in the last years. Kubernetes is the orchestration tool written and used by Google. OpenShift is by RedHat, and is specially suited for Enterprises like us. The basic building block is Docker which makes immutability and automation possible.

        Exactly! If you run the server within Docker, Docker tricks each of those programs, and let it believe it is the only one existing in the server.

        Yes! It segregates it in sort a of cage, a container. And it allows to build and configure that cage, in a very detailed way, so that a cage resemble a server in all details, from network, to certifications, and so on. For example, we may build a cage that is identical to our SN101
